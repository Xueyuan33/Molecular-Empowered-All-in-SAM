# Fine-grained Multi-class Nuclei Segmentation with Molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model
## Overview
In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM model, a holistic framework designed for precise cell segmentation and nuclei classification. Our model adopts a full-stack approach, which comprises: (1) annotation—employing molecular-empowered learning to engage lay annotators and minimize the need for intricate pixel-level annotations, (2) learning—modifying the SAM model to focus on specific semantics, thereby capitalizing on its robust generalizability through the use of an SAM adapter, and (3) refinement—boosting segmentation accuracy by incorporating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL).
